# CSS_Foundations
A place for us to test out the Odin Project's CSS foundational knowledge along with us going back to our HTML basics.
We will be testing out various CSS selectors, properties, and demonstrating our current knowledge of the Cascade.

This is not meant to look pretty, it is purely to practice CSS, HTML and using Git.
